Retrobie’s main goal is to provide a modern, convenient way to buy and receive a new, provably authentic pair of shoes. In a world of companies like Amazon, it’s a shame Kenya doesn’t have a single company that uses the internet so innovatively. And yet, Kenya boasts “the fastest internet in East and Central Africa.” To that I say, “Ha!”

The internet is just a tool. What are we using that tool _for_? Enough rambling.

Retrobie aims to be one of Africa’s first true giants. Jumia is perhaps the most formidable force in the e-commerce space, but it’s more of the same shit as always - let’s make money… yeah, yummy delicious money! And then what? I don’t know what made Jumia fail, but what I can say is that despite their size, their incredible economies of scale and sheer volume of resources, they have nothing to show!

In my view, they are just a website that stocks a random assortment of products… They don’t have anything you can call ‘uniquely Jumia.’ Not even a logo! Ha! That’s supposed to be the beacon of technological advancement in Africa? Don’t make me laugh.

Ultimately, my biggest problem with them, their continual stocking of counterfeit shit, the ever increasing encroachment of “shipped from abroad” products and almost complete lack of any good tech gadgets aside, is their complete lack of innovation. In my view, Safaricom hasn’t done much either, because I had to bring that up. Mpesa is a story for another day, and I don’t want to discuss it here because I’m of the opinion government support, more than anything, is what’s propped up that greedy, capitalistic company for so long. Ultimately, Kenya, and indeed, Africa, needs something it can call “uniquely African.” Free from all that “filthy” European and American money. Something built, financed and grown straight from home and presented to the rest of the world.

Can I build Retrobie from the ground up to be such a formidable force? A force to challenge even what’s now a behemoth that I can’t imagine could ever be brought down. Funny as it sounds, and as small as it really is in the grand scheme of things, I really think Safaricom’s scale and size and things to be reckoned with.

I’ve been experiencing continual bouts of wanting to know where I’m from since a few months ago this year. I finally got to satisfy that thirst when I visited my hometown all the way in Nyakune, Kanyada (Canda). Without getting into too much about myself or the situation at home, I was struck by just how utterly poor and rural the place was. Mud houses, compounds with ten huts inside - each apparently belonging to a family member or the other, grass-thatched houses… But, despite all of that, there was still room for a little _kibanda_ where you could deposit or withdraw money from Mpesa.
